# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
We are helping Basil and Sadhana to build a tool that will allow many people to access information on earthquakes across the globe. The tool will show people the difference of magnitudes of eathquakes across the globe over the prior seven days.

## Resources
- Sofware: Visual Studio Code
- Language: JavaSript
- Language: HTML
- Datasource: GeoJSON
- Library: D3.js
- Library: Bootstrap CSS style
- Library: Leaflet (to plot data on Mapbox map)

## Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data 

The task was to create a layer of tectonic plates around the world so we can we see how relative the tectonic plates are with earthquakes. We created the overlay object to give it the option to turn on or off.

## Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

We added new layer data for major earthquakes as well to the overlay object and with the abilitiy to turn it on and off .

## Deliverable 3: Add Additional Map
I was able to leverage the code we used to build the 2 map layers we already had, then changed the style that was referenced and add the new map to the baseMaps layer, giving users another map style to choose from.

## Summary
We have now helped Basil and Sadhana to put together a great tool for many stakeholders to access earthquake data from around the world along with some additional information along with tectonic plate information... with ability to view all information together or separate also making it interesting by having 3 different map styles that users can choose from and with the legend at the bottom right to show the magnitude level.
